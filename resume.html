	<h3>Education</h3>
	
	<strong>Greenville Technical College - Greenville, SC Associates in Arts, May 2010</strong>

	<p>Through studying the arts, I learned that there are a million ways of looking at life and all of the problems we face on a day-to-day basis. I also learned that there's something philosophers call "the human experience" that brings us all together at the end of the day, and art is a way of understanding and relating that experience.</p>

	<p>When I started programing I noticed art in the markup and styling process using HTML and CSS, but once I got over the numbers and formulaic nature of functional programming, I began to see art emerge in the patterns. Just like art allows the artist to express himself freely, programming is an outlet for the developer to solve problems in a unique way and apply personality to his work.</p>

	<h3>Work</h3>

	<strong>Barista Extraordinaire December 2009-August 2012</strong>

	<p>Across various esteemed coffee venues, I learned the ins-and-outs of what really makes a great cup of joe great. I'm not trying to church up my days serving coffee, but I'm a firm believer that if you look hard enough, you can learn valuable lessons no matter where you are.</p>

	<p>I learned that making good coffee is a craft, but making great coffee is a true art form. I learned that to do anything well, it takes great patience and dedication. I also learned that a job well done often goes unnoticed, and self-motivation to get the details right is one of my most valued traits as a result.</p>
