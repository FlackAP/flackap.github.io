This project proved to be much more challenging than I initially imagined, but I've learned a great deal in the process and have some exciting new features coming down the pipe.</p>

                    <p class="description">After graduating from the academy, I was approached by The Iron Yard to create a series of web-pages for their cowork spaces. The idea behind the project was to eliminate waste, as the welcoming packet was previously printed from PDF files to paper. Given the freedom to design and develop the pages myself,  this is my first freelance project and one of my personal favorites.</p>

                    <p class="description">Another Iron Yard project, this assignment was an exercise in designing a web page that can be viewed on any device- from the monitor on your desk to the smartphone in the palm of your hand. I was given two image files with the site layed out for me and challenged to duplicate the full and mobile versions using html5, css3, and media queries.</p>

                    <p>My name is Andy Flack, and I'm a front end web developer. My story is a winding tale of seeking fortune in studies of history, art, and sustainable coffee. You can read more about that on my resume if you'd like, but the most important thing you should know about me is that I love working with people to solve problems, and that's why the world of programming is my place. I've never found a more welcoming community of people tenacious enough to tackle problems that will eventually effect almost every person on the planet. Try not to think about it too long, because that's some mind-blowing stuff.</p>

                    <p>I recently graduated from <a href="http://theironyard.com/education" target="_blank">The Iron Yard Academy,</a> an intensive, 3-month program that took me from zero to Backbone.js. Becoming a programmer was a wild experience. Not only did I learn to build fully-functional web apps, but I also learned how to think like an engineer. I've found myself applying an equally formulaic and intuitive way of thinking to nearly every problem I've run into outside of my studies, I'm more cool and collected whenever something doesn't go my way, and I'm far less willing to give up when I do encounter roadblocks. I often joke that I'm on the road to becoming an internet wizard, but I truly feel like I've learned some magical stuff. To get a good idea of how I work, check out my <a href="http://osrc.dfm.io/flackap" target="_blank">Open Source Report Card</a>.</p>

                    <h4>I can't wait for the opportunity to apply these skills to great projects alongside great people.</h4>

                    <p>When I'm not hacking, you can generally find me playing music (bass, drums, and keyboard), discovering new craft beer, or playing with the greatest dog in the world (sorry fellow pet-owners!), Rocky.</p>
