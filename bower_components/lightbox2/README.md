# Lightbox2

The original lightbox script. Eight years later â€” still going strong!

Lightbox is small javascript library used to overlay images on top of the current page. It's a snap to setup and works on all modern browsers.

## Roadmap

### Actively being worked on

- **Maintenance.** Get open Issues and PRs number down.

### Not on the roadmap

- **HTML or video content.** The goal of the script from the start has been to provide a better image viewing experience and I am planning on staying focused on that vision. Don't worry though there are plenty of alternative scripts a google away for those who need HTML or video content support.

### v3.0 - In Brainstorming Phase

- Add touch gesture support.
- Rewrite animations for performance and flexibility.
- Optimize layout for mobile.
- Optimize layout for screens of varying densities.
- Use inline SVG for UI elements.
- Do not initialize automatically and allow multiple instances.
- Add event handlers.
- Allow the setting of options from HTML.
- Allow instantiation with jQuery plugin syntax.
- If one of the two options, maxWidth or maxHeight, is set, maintain aspect ratio.
- Evaluate start, end, and transition animations.
- Evaluate preloading and caching.
- Evaluate droppping jQuery requirement.
- If user attempts to go forward when at end of image set, animation (shake?) indicating the end or option to close Lightbox.
