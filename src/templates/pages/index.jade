              | My name is Andy Flack, and I'm a front end engineer. In a previous life, I was your (mostly) friendly neighborhood barista. 
              | Eventually finding myself unsatisfied with the daily grind of grinding coffee, I began to explore the world of web development.
              | In 2013, I put everything in my life on hold for three months in order to pursue an education in front end development at <a href="http://theironyard.com">The Iron Yard Academy</a> 
              | and never looked back.<br><br> Since then, I've had the opportunity to work alongside other great developers, building everything from websites for non-profits and colleges to mobile apps that track family healthcare records. You can read about all of that and more in my <a href="/resume">résumé</a>.
              | If I'm not typing away feverishly with a furrowed brow, I'm probably finding a good spot to set up the hammock with <a class="fancybox" href="images/rocky.jpg">Rockefeller</a>, my canine companion.
