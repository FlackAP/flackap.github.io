    h3 Dubose Web Group
    strong Front End Engineer, December 2015- March 2016 
    p
      | At Dubose Web, I was tasked with overseeing the front-end development of new websites.
      | From meeting with clients to working with the designers, I was able to take ownership
      | of every project that came through the door.
      br
      br
      | My experiences at Dubose Web allowed me to experience a leadership position while learning
      | valuable skills from other team members. This was also great exposure to working with a CMS
      | as all projects were built using ExpressionEngine.

    p(style="margin-top:15px")
      | I was approached by The Iron Yard when a major restructuring of their website was needed.
      | I was charged with rebuilding the website, utilizing jade templates, modular scss, and the gulp build system.
      | I was also in charge of building the styleguide for The Iron Yard, known as Ghost Shield.
      br
      br
      | This was an invaluable experience as I was able to work alongside partners, students,
      | and teachers at the Iron Yard as well as open source contributers to the project. Using
      | the latest and greatest in front end development technologies, I was able to oversee an ambitious and successful restructuring.         
    h3 ChartSpan Medical Technologies
    strong Front-End/iOS Developer, January 2014-May 2014 
    p
      | Fresh from the Iron Yard Academy, I was offered a position at ChartSpan as a junior front-end developer.
      | I was given the opportunity to build an app using jQuery mobile and Trigger.io and to continue my learning
      | under the mentorship of Terry Horner. It was at ChartSpan that I learned how to work with a small,
      | three-developer team by tackling whatever problems we faced while establishing accountability and taking pride
      | in the good work that we were doing.
      br
      br
      | After two months of building out a behavior-driven testing system for the app and researching/testing multiple MVC frameworks that we planned to put into place, it became clear that we needed to change direction and build the app for native platforms. I spent the next month and a half learning how to develop in Objective-C using Xcode as well as creating the foundation for the app by laying out storyboards, connecting the app to Localytics for marketing analytics, and building out the password retrieval functionality.

      | The Iron Yard Academy- Greenville, SC
    h4 Front End Engineering, October 2013
    p
      | In three months time, I was able to go from virtually no understanding of web development
      | to writing functional webapps that utilized Backbone.js, Parse.js, and API calls. At the Iron Yard, I felt as if my thirst for knowledge was finally being satisfied;
      | I knew that programming was my way of fulfilling the potential I've always seen in myself.
    p
      | The program exposed me to a field that I've come to love for the culture and the opportunity
      | to complete challenging and meaningful projects. I completed several projects in the
      | three-month program, and after graduation I have had the opportunity to work alongside
      | members of the Iron Yard family. The most valuable lesson I learned in my time at the
      | Iron Yard Academy is that there is always more to learn and one's skills as a developer can constantly improve.    

    //- h2 Pre-programming
    //- h3 Education
    //- strong Greenville Technical College - Greenville, SC Associates in Arts, May 2010
    //- p
    //-   | Through studying the arts, I learned that there are a million ways of looking at life and all of the problems we face on a day-to-day basis. I also learned that there's something philosophers call "the human experience" that brings us all together at the end of the day, and art is a way of understanding and relating that experience.
    //- p
    //-   | When I started programing I noticed art in the markup and styling process using HTML and CSS, but once I got over the numbers and formulaic nature of functional programming, I began to see art emerge in the patterns. Just like art allows the artist to express himself freely, programming is an outlet for the developer to solve problems in a unique way and apply personality to his work.

    //-   | Across various esteemed coffee venues, I learned the ins-and-outs of what really makes a great cup of joe great. At the risk of churching up my days serving coffee, but I'm a firm believer that if you look hard enough, you can learn valuable lessons no matter where you are.
    //- p
    //-   | I learned that making good coffee is a craft, but making great coffee is a true art form. I learned that to do anything well, it takes great patience and dedication. I also learned that a job well done often goes unnoticed, and self-motivation to get the details right is one of my most valued traits as a result.
